/* Deserialize a Simplicity 'program' and execute it in the environment of the 'ix'th input of 'tx' with `taproot`.
 * If program isn't a proper encoding of a Simplicity program, including its 'program_len', '*success' is set to false.
 * If 'amr != NULL' and the annotated Merkle root of the decoded expression doesn't match 'amr' then '*success' is set to false.
 * Otherwise evaluation proceeds and '*success' is set to the result of evaluation.
 * If 'imr != NULL' and '*success' is set to true, then the identity Merkle root of the decoded expression is written to 'imr'.
 * Otherwise if 'imr != NULL' then 'imr' may or may not be written to.
 *
 * If at any time there is a transient error, such as malloc failing then 'false' is returned, and 'success' may be modified.
 * Otherwise, 'true' is returned.
