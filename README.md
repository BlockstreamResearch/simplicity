# Simplicity

Simplicity is a blockchain programming language designed as an alternative to Bitcoin script.

The language and implementation is still under development.

## Contents

This project contains

* A Haskell implementation of Simplicity's language semantics, type inference engine, serialization functions, and some example Simplicity code.
* A Coq implementation of Simplicity's formal denotational and operational semantics.

## Build

### Building with Nix

Software artifacts can be built using [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/).

* To build the Haskell project, run `nix-build -A haskell`.
* To build the Coq project, run `nix-build -A coq`.
* For a Simplicity-Haskell development environment, type `nix-shell --arg coq false`.
* Typing `nix-shell` will provide a full C, Coq and Haskell development environment.

### Building without Nix

To build the Coq project, we first need to build the VST dependency.

1. Download and extract the lastest VST from <https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/VST/archive/v2.4.tar.gz>.
1. Build the VST project by running `make` in the extracted directory.  If you are in a rush it is sufficent to run `make sha/functional_prog.vo`.
(Tip: if you have a newer version of Coq, you can try setting the environment variable `IGNORECOQVERSION=true`.)
1. Install the VST project into your user's `.local/share` (or `XDG_DATA_HOME`) directory by running
    1. `mkdir -p ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/coq/VST`
    1. `cp -r msl sepcomp veric floyd ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/coq/VST`
    1. `cp -r compcert sha ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/coq`

Now we can build the Simplicity project.
1. Enter the `Coq` directory.
1. Execute `coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o CoqMakefile`.
1. Build the project by executing `make -f CoqMakefile`.
